# 11 Complexity and Performance

Getting the correct result and having well-structured and documented code are only two aspects of a good program. We also want our code to execute fast and, in some cases, for it to finish running in a moment, hour, day, year, lifetime... This week we more formally discuss algorithmic complexity and performance. In addition to theoretical considerations we look into measuring execution time and benchmarking specific operations.
